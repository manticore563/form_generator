# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to create a custom form platform specifically designed for student enrollment in colleges. The platform will serve as an alternative to Google Forms with enhanced capabilities for collecting sensitive information like Aadhar numbers, passport-size photos, and signatures. The system includes form creation tools, file upload with cropping functionality, admin dashboard, data export capabilities, and an automatic installer for easy deployment on shared hosting platforms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a college administrator, I want to create custom enrollment forms with various field types including sensitive data fields, so that I can collect comprehensive student information that Google Forms cannot handle.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the form builder THEN the system SHALL provide options to add text fields, dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons, file uploads, and Aadhar number fields
2. WHEN an admin creates a form THEN the system SHALL generate a unique shareable link for that form
3. WHEN an admin saves a form THEN the system SHALL store the form configuration in the database
4. IF a form contains an Aadhar field THEN the system SHALL validate the 12-digit format
5. WHEN an admin publishes a form THEN the system SHALL make it accessible via the generated link

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student, I want to fill out enrollment forms and upload my photo and signature with cropping capabilities, so that I can submit properly formatted documents for my enrollment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student accesses a form link THEN the system SHALL display the custom form with all configured fields
2. WHEN a student uploads a photo THEN the system SHALL provide a cropping interface to adjust the image to passport size dimensions
3. WHEN a student uploads a signature THEN the system SHALL provide a cropping interface to properly frame the signature
4. WHEN a student crops an image THEN the system SHALL save the cropped version to a dedicated server folder
5. WHEN a student submits the form THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields before submission
6. IF form submission is successful THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message with submission ID

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a college administrator, I want to access an admin dashboard to manage forms and view submissions, so that I can efficiently handle the enrollment process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin logs into the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a list of all created forms
2. WHEN an admin selects a form THEN the system SHALL show all submissions for that form
3. WHEN an admin views submissions THEN the system SHALL display form data along with links to uploaded photos and signatures
4. WHEN an admin clicks on photo/signature links THEN the system SHALL allow direct download of the files
5. WHEN an admin accesses form analytics THEN the system SHALL show submission counts and timestamps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a college administrator, I want to export form data to CSV format with file links, so that I can process enrollment data in external systems and access uploaded documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin requests data export THEN the system SHALL generate a CSV file containing all form responses
2. WHEN the CSV is generated THEN the system SHALL include direct download links for photos and signatures in separate columns
3. WHEN someone clicks the links in the CSV THEN the system SHALL serve the actual image files for download
4. IF a form has no submissions THEN the system SHALL generate an empty CSV with headers only
5. WHEN export is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a download link for the CSV file

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want an automatic installer for the platform, so that I can easily deploy it on any shared hosting environment without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the installer is accessed for the first time THEN the system SHALL display a setup wizard
2. WHEN database credentials are provided THEN the installer SHALL test the connection and create necessary tables
3. WHEN admin account details are entered THEN the installer SHALL create the initial admin user
4. WHEN installation is complete THEN the installer SHALL redirect to the admin login page
5. IF the system is already installed THEN the installer SHALL redirect to the main application
6. WHEN installation fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with troubleshooting steps

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a student or administrator, I want the platform to work seamlessly across different devices and browsers, so that I can access it from any environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the platform is accessed on mobile devices THEN the interface SHALL be responsive and touch-friendly
2. WHEN forms are displayed THEN they SHALL adapt to different screen sizes appropriately
3. WHEN image cropping is used on mobile THEN the interface SHALL support touch gestures
4. WHEN the platform is accessed via different browsers THEN all functionality SHALL work consistently
5. IF JavaScript is disabled THEN the system SHALL display a message requiring JavaScript activation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a college administrator, I want secure file storage and access controls, so that student data and documents are protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL store them in protected directories outside the web root when possible
2. WHEN file access is requested THEN the system SHALL verify proper authorization before serving files
3. WHEN forms are submitted THEN the system SHALL sanitize all input data to prevent security vulnerabilities
4. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL log the attempt and deny access
5. WHEN admin sessions expire THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication for sensitive operations
